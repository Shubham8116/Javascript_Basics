1) Javascript is synchronous(one by one code running).
2) Javascript is single threaded.
3) It executes one line of code at a time.
4) Each operation waits for the last one to complete before execution.

5) blocking code vs non blocking code -

blocking code blocks the flow of execution like for example first it read the file then other operation will be done.
non blocking code do not block the flow of execution for example file reading in background while other operations are performed.

so it is based on the use cases whether to write blocking or non blocking code.

setTimeout is used for scheduling a function to run after a specified delay. setInterval is used for running a function repeatedly at specified intervals.

If the program has setTimeout and setInterval methods then are added to task queue , later they are added to call stack.
