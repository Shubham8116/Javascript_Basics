1) console.log() is a developer tool in browser provided by google chrome's v8 engine .
v8 engine and nodeJS is written in c++.

2) Promise -
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed. 

fetch - 
1) The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources across the network.
 It is more powerful and replacement for XMLHttpRequest.

2) It returns a Promise which uses resolve and reject object.
If interviewer asks about server error code 404 handled by then or catch ? -
so it is handled by then.
404 -" Page Not Found," indicates that the server cannot locate the specific webpage requested by the user.

fetch's priority is high, it runs first then other code executes.
in memory there is a special queue other than task queue called as 'priority queue' .
the fetch callback goes into this queue and put into the call stack first then other callbacks or functions added into the call stack.
working of fetch -
when fetch is executes, it first do 2 tasks-
1) it creates two memory onfulfilled and onrejection.
2) it calls the resource across network
then the response is stored in onfulfilled and errors are stored in onrejection.
then we get the actual data in .then() and .catch() .
