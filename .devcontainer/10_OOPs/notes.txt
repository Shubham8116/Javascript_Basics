Javascript is a prototype based language.
when we use new keyword constructor function gets called ex. new promise().
means a new object is created and properties are assigned to that object.

Prototype -

In JavaScript, prototype is a powerful feature that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects
if a property or method not found in an object then JavaScript look for it using prototype chaining(prototype inside prototype) until it reaches null.
You can add methods to a prototype or object.
example - 
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

const alice = new Person("Alice");
alice.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice

*** agar ek object ko dusre object ki property ka access dena hai to prototype use karna- 
Object.setPrototypeOf(object1,object2) // object 1 will access properties of object2 .
